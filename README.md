Creating web application version of MREEG: Modular Realtime EEG Education Guide.

Fields to add:
Background:
PDR (wiggle room around correct)
reactivity
organization
symmetry
normal variants (multivalued)

Artifact:
Artifact type (multivalued)
Artifact severity

Sleep:
Stages of sleep (multivalued)

Slowing: 
lateralization
localization
frequency (delta or theta vs numbers; multivalued)
rhythm (rhythmic, semi-rhythmic, quasi-rhythmic, arhythmic)
morphology (monomorphic, polymorphic)
[easier way to enter common types of slowing; TIRDA vs generalized slowing vs FIRDA, any IRDA, LIRDA, OIRDA, focal polymorphic vs generalized monomorphic]

Epileptiform/spikes:
lateralization
localization
prevalence
modifier (optional; no score)

Seizures:
start
stop
site of origin (focal - lateralization/localization, generalized)
secondary generalization (yes/no)

EKG (arrhythmia - yes/no)

Hyperventilation (focal slowing, focal discharges, expected slowing, excess generalized slowing) [multivalued; also may need to implement subfield to describe focal discharges and/or focal slowing]

Photic stimulation (multivalued: evoked discharges, no driving, evidence of driving)

Relevant findings (most pertinent abnormal findings -> essentially the summary part of an EEG report)

Interpretation -> these findings demonstrate etc etc (last 1-2 sentences of EEG report)
